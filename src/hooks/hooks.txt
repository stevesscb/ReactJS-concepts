1. What is a ReactJS hook?

- Hooks let you use different React features from your components. You can either use the built-in Hooks or combine them to build your own. This page lists all built-in Hooks in React.

  - State lets a component store information, Eg the input value or an output value index.
    - useState();
    - useReducer();

* Context Hooks

* Your own hooks (custom hooks)
