1. What is the useRef hook?

  - useRef is a React Hook that lets you reference a value that’s not needed for rendering.

  * Must be used at the top level of a component.

PARAMETERS:

  initialValue: The value you want the ref object’s current property to be initially. It can be a value of any type. This argument is ignored after the initial render.

RETURNS:

  useRef returns an object with a single property:

  current: Initially, it’s set to the initialValue you have passed. You can later set it to something else. If you pass the ref object to React as a ref attribute to a JSX node, React will set its current property.
  On the next renders, useRef will return the same object

2. When to use a useRef hook?

 - Perfect for reading values only.
